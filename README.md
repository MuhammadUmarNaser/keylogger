# 🔐 Keystroke Logging Security Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the concept of **keystroke logging** from a cybersecurity perspective. It was developed as part of a learning task to understand how keyboard input can be monitored and why such techniques pose serious security and privacy risks.

The focus of this project is **educational analysis**, not malicious use.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how keyboard input is handled by operating systems
- Study how keystroke logging attacks work conceptually
- Analyze risks related to password and data theft
- Learn defensive and preventive security measures

---

## 🧠 What is Keylogging?
Keylogging is a technique used to record keys pressed on a keyboard. It can be used legitimately for testing and monitoring but is commonly abused by malware to steal sensitive information.

---

## 🚨 Security Risks
Keylogging attacks can capture:
- Login credentials
- Credit card numbers
- Personal messages
- Banking information

This can lead to:
- Identity theft
- Account compromise
- Financial fraud
- Privacy violations

---

## 🛡️ Prevention & Defense
To protect against keylogging threats:
- Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Install trusted antivirus software
- Keep your system updated
- Avoid untrusted downloads
- Monitor suspicious system behavior

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Referenced
- Python (for understanding input handling)
- Operating System Input APIs (theory)
- Cybersecurity defense techniques

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project builds awareness of cybersecurity threats and helps understand how attackers misuse system input mechanisms. It emphasizes ethical practices and defensive strategies.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Notice
This project is strictly for **educational purposes**. Unauthorized monitoring of users or systems without consent is illegal and unethical.
